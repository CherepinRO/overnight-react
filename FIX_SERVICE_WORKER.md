# 🔧 Fix Service Worker Cache Issue

## 🐛 Problem

The app is showing cached errors because an active Service Worker is serving old JavaScript files, even though the code has been fixed.

## ✅ Solution: Unregister Service Worker

### Method 1: Automatic Tool (Easiest)

1. Visit this page in your browser:
   ```
   http://localhost:5000/unregister-sw.html
   ```

2. Click the button to unregister the service worker

3. Follow the instructions to hard refresh

### Method 2: Browser DevTools

1. Open DevTools (Press F12)
2. Go to **Application** tab (Chrome/Edge) or **Storage** tab (Firefox)
3. Click **Service Workers** in the left sidebar
4. Find the registered service worker
5. Click **Unregister**
6. Close DevTools
7. **Hard refresh** the page: `Ctrl + Shift + R` (or `Cmd + Shift + R` on Mac)

### Method 3: Console Command

1. Open DevTools Console (F12)
2. Run this command:
   ```javascript
   navigator.serviceWorker.getRegistrations().then(registrations => {
     registrations.forEach(r => r.unregister());
     caches.keys().then(names => names.forEach(n => caches.delete(n)));
     console.log('✅ Service worker unregistered and caches cleared');
     location.reload(true);
   });
   ```
3. The page will automatically reload

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### 1. Removed TooltipProvider
- ✅ Removed `TooltipProvider` from `App.tsx`
- ✅ App no longer uses Radix UI Tooltip
- ✅ Charts use Recharts Tooltip instead

### 2. Removed "use client" Directives
- ✅ Removed from 15 UI component files
- ✅ These are Next.js directives, not needed in Vite

### 3. Disabled Service Worker in Development
- ✅ Service worker now only registers in production
- ✅ Modified `client/src/main.tsx` to check `import.meta.env.PROD`
- ✅ No more aggressive caching in development

## 📋 Verification Steps

After unregistering the service worker:

1. ✅ No "Invalid hook call" errors
2. ✅ No "Cannot read properties of null" errors
3. ✅ App loads successfully
4. ✅ Dashboard displays correctly
5. ✅ All features work as expected

## 🚨 Manual Steps Required

**YOU MUST:**
1. Visit `/unregister-sw.html` OR use DevTools to unregister
2. Close all tabs with the app
3. Open app in a fresh tab
4. Hard refresh (`Ctrl+Shift+R` or `Cmd+Shift+R`)

The service worker is registered in the browser and won't go away until you manually unregister it!

## 🎉 After Unregistering

Once the service worker is unregistered and you hard refresh:
- ✅ No more TooltipProvider errors
- ✅ Clean console logs
- ✅ App works perfectly
- ✅ Service worker only activates in production builds
